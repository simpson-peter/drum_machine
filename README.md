It was created by [Peter Simpson](petersimpson.me) using Flutter Web. Audio assets are thanks to _Mulishaa_, _92elm_, Liveschool, and Daniel Wray.

## Design
What's My App is implemented in Dart and utilizes the Flutter framework's web functionality.

## Repository Contents
The majority of the files in this repository are generated by the flutter framework to control app production. The files and directories which are unique to this project are:

 - `lib/`
 - `pubspec.yaml`
 - `README.md` *(You are here)*
 
`pubspec.yaml` lists the project dependencies, which can be loaded through running a `pub get` command.

**`lib/`** contains the website source code. 

The release build can be found in `/build/web/`, and can be run by loading `index.html`.


## Known Issues

 - Lack of support for browsers other than Google and Firefox due to audio player failures on other platforms.
 - Rapidly toggling the on/off button destroys playback
 - The site is not responsive to mobile browsers.
 - The site has not been tested on any tablet devices.
 - Audio can stutter on initial playback.
 - Occasional audio clipping when asset load is high.
